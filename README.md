Why is it a good idea for “lower” application layers not to be aware of “higher” ones?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The fundamental motivation is this: </p><blockquote><p><em>You want to be able to rip an entire layer out and substitute a completely different (rewritten) one, and NOBODY SHOULD (BE ABLE TO) NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.</em> </p></blockquote><p>The most obvious example is ripping the bottom layer out and substituting a different one. This is what you do when you develop the upper layer(s) against a simulation of the hardware, and then substitute in the real hardware.</p><p>Also layers, modules, indeed architecture itself, are means of making computer programs easier to understand by humans. </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13439/what-defines-a-software-architect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Why is it a good idea for “lower” application layers not to be aware of “higher” ones?

What Is Middle Tier Clustering?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><em>Middle tier clustering</em> is just a cluster that is used for service the middle tier in a application. This is popular since many clients may be using middle tier and a lot of heavy load may also be served by middle tier that requires it be to highly available.  </p><p>Failure of middle tier can cause multiple clients and systems to fail, therefore its one of the approaches to do clustering at the middle tier of a application. In general any application that has a business logic that can be shared across multiple client can use a middle tier cluster for high availability.  </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is Middle Tier Clustering?

Why layering your application is important? Provide some bad layering example.</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>Each component should contain 'layers' - a dedicated object for the web, logic and data access code. This not only draws a clean <em>separation of concerns</em> but also significantly eases mocking and testing the system. </p><p>Though this is a very common pattern, API developers tend to mix layers by passing the web layer objects (for example Express req, res) to business logic and data layers - this makes your application dependant on and accessible by Express only. App that mixes web objects with other layers can not be accessed by testing code, CRON jobs and other non-Express callers</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/production/LTSrelease.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Why layering your application is important?
